## Intents


Through Intents, the Android apps communicate between their components and other apps.

They carry data between apps/components just like GET/POST requests in HTTP communications.

Intents are generally used to/as :

* Start an activity.
* Broadcasts to inform the system and app changes.
* Start/stop or communicate with background services.
* access data via ContentProviders.
* callbacks as event handlers.

Intents if not declared securely can be vulnerable.
